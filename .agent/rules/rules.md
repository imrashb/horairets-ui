1. Everything must be stricly typed. You must avoid using "any" at all cost
2. When doing responsive CSS with media queries, ALWAYS use the theme breakpoints
3. Avoid writing comments. Documentation on a specific reusable component for example is fine, but comments that say what the code does is not good. Instead, try writing better variable and function names, and use DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID principles.
